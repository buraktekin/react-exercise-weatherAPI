# React Weather App

### Demo
You can find a live version of this project [Here](http://elixir7.github.io/react-exercise-weatherAPI/public/#/)

### Development
To try it out clone this repo. Run `npm install` and then run `http-server -p 3000`, then locate to localhost:3000/#/weather in your browser.

### Improvements
Start-view for the user to read how it works and if they want to use Geolocation or search by city. (check)
Change background color depending on temperature or use the codedrop.com amazing background with realistic raindrops.
Add whole day forecast when clicking on that day. (almost done)
Add a spinner to when the app is finding the location and sending API request.
Add more exact icons by checking id of icons [Here](http://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)
Fix popupDay to not use the custom.css styling but instead use the inline styling in the component.

### Ideas
Since raindrops with javascript seems to be very hard to implement and might be difficult to read text on. Instead use a gradient background which is depending on the weather temperature.
